DailyOje (Daily OnlineJournalEntry) is a javascript/html/php/mysql project for easy, distraction free writing. 

There is a basic login system with Twitter OAuth integration or the standard email/password combo.

##Setup

resources/dailyoje.sql has the SQL to create the necessary SQL tables.

All configuration is done in includes/class.config.php. This project heavily utilizes [Simple-Php-Framework](https://github.com/tylerhall/simple-php-framework). Please follow this project for configuration details. There are some additional configurations items that we have added. They are all commented.

At the very least set $twitterConsumerKey, $twitterConsumerSecret, $dbReadUsername,$dbWriteUsername,$dbReadPassword, and $dbWritePassword.


##Demo 

There is a loginless and stateless demo [available here].
